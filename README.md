I am using the amazing [JupyterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite) to host browser-based interactive Jupyter notebooks.

> NOTE: The interactive notebook session is using your device resources and local storage, so
> this is different from using an online colab site, such as, [DeepNote](https://deepnote.com) or [Google Colab](https://colab.google).
