# Machine Learning Projects

This repo contains a sampling of Python Jupyter notebooks I write about on my website. I am using the amazing [JupyterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite) to host browser-based interactive Jupyter notebooks.

> NOTE: The interactive notebook session is using your device resources and local storage, so
> this is different from using an online colab site, such as, DeepNote - https://deepnote.com or Google Colab - https://colab.google.
